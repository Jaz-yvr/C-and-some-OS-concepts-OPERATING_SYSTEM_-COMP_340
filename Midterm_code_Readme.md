# COMP_340
Construct both SJF and SJF with preemption process schedulers in one multiple-queue program that compiles in C. Run a few examples and compare how the two algorithms perform given variation in the input processes (be sure to use both CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes in your examples). Also, formally discuss the degree of multiprogramming for each of your example runs. Be sure to comment thoroughly throughout your code describing each major step in detail. (Attach your source code and screen shots to demonstrate that it compiles).  If you use Visual Studio, then attach those files so I can easily run them myself. If you use another IDE, then attach those application-specific files instead. DO NOT JUST PLACE CODE INTO THIS WORD DOCUMENT.![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()
